## DO NOT EDIT OR DELETE THIS FILE! If you need to make changes, then copy this file, save it as "config.cfg" in the 
## plugin root directory, and edit that file instead!

# This is the configuration file for the Rockstar plugin. It contains settings which advanced users may change to alter
# how the plugin functions. An explanation describing what each setting does is provided beneath each setting.

user_presence_mode=0
# Default Value: 0
# Allowed Values:
#   - 0 (Disable User Presence)
#   - 1 (Display Last Played Game)
#   - 2 (Display Grand Theft Auto Online Character Stats)
#   - 3 (Display Red Dead Online Character Stats)
#
# NOTE: If this setting is set to any value other than 0, then all friends who have played at least one game will
# constantly appear online. This is because Galaxy 2.0 currently displays only online friends in the sidebar. However,
# seeing that the friend is online in this sidebar does NOT mean that the friend is actually online on the Social Club!
#
# Since the online status of a Social Club user is found via an endpoint with its own API, bearer token, and more, it is
# not feasible to get the presence of a user's friends. (For those wondering, the endpoint is
# https://prod.ros.rockstargames.com/scui/v2/api/friend/getfriends.)
# Due to this limitation, a more creative approach has been taken as a compromise for importing friend presence status.
# The allowed values along with their respective meanings are displayed above.

log_sensitive_data=False
# Default Value: False
# Allowed Values:
#   - True
#   - False
# If set to true, this setting will add extra information to the log file generated by the Rockstar plugin. This
# information is highly sensitive in nature, and may compromise the security of your Rockstar account. As such, this
# setting is best left to false, unless you are debugging the plugin.

debug_always_refresh=False
# Default Value: False
# Allowed Values:
#   - True
#   - False
# If set to true, the plugin will always attempt to refresh the user's credentials upon launching Galaxy 2.0. This is
# useful for debugging credential refreshing, but serves no purpose for the average user.
